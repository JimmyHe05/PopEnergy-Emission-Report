# PopEnergy-Emission-Report
This report examines the relationship between a country's population and the methane emissions from its energy sector.
I created a scatter plot and perform a linear regression analysis to see if there's a correlation between population and energy emissions. The goal is to understand the relationship between population and energy emissions and to identify the most impactful energy segments.
